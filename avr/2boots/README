2boots
------

What is this ?

This is a dual bootloader for Atmel AVR atmega chips. It combines 
a serial bootloader and a mmc/sd card based one in the same 2kb of flash
memory that is normally used by the arduino serial loader alone.

Why does it exists ?

Well, I have quite a few arduino "in the field". I can simply drag a .hex
file to an SD card, insert it in an SD shield, and field-upgrade my boards
without additional hardware.
