2boots
------

This is a dual bootloader for Atmel AVR atmega chips. It combines 
a serial bootloader and a mmc/sd card based one in the same 2kb of flash
memory that is normally used by the arduino serial loader alone.

You might ask Why? Well, I have quite a few arduino "in the field". 
I can simply drag a .hex file to an SD card, insert it in an SD shield,
and field-upgrade my boards without additional hardware. At the same time, 
I can connect the serial port and start developping with the normal Arduino 
IDE.

Features:
* Uses just 2kb of flash, so it fits into the normal boot block of most atmegas
* Serial bootloader is arduino compatible (avrdude / stk500v1)
* MMC bootloader can read directly a *.hex file
* Supported are FAT16 formatted cards up to 1GB in size
* All of ladyada's fixes to the original bootloader are included
